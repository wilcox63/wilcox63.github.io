### Abstract
The team was tasked with finding a dataset, and then creating research questions and a procedure using regression techniques in RStudio in order to answer the research questions and perform data analysis on the dataset. The team explored correlations between variables and both popularity and MSRP. Popularity correlations were later found to be skewed by the brand variable. MSRP, however, revealed that the most expensive vehicles tend to require premium unleaded gas, have automated manual transmissions, and rear-wheel drive. For a fully in depth view, please see the project write-up below.
