I was tasked with creating an algorithm in Python that would aid in the analysis of a dataset to answer research questions of my own choice. Following an especially interesting football season, I chose to research what factors effect the success of an extra point kick. Using a binomial distribution (similar to simulating a coin flip) and the research I did, I created analgorithm that could predict extra point kicks with roughly 80% accuracy when compared to regular season statistics. For more information, see the presentation linked below.
