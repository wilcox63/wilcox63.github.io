This project was a continuation of the [It's a Game Winner!](/posts/2022-12-06-its-a-game-winner.md) project I did during my sophomore year. I was tasked with choosing an optimizaton platform and creating a project that would adapt to it's area of expertise as well as show off the power of its optimizaton tools. I chose Python Numba specifically because my previous project had almost completely utilized NumPy.
