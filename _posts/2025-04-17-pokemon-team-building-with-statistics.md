This project was assigned to evaluate the learning of students during a class which focused on building technical visualization skills, as well as increasing information retention and accessibility to said graphics. As a result, the subject matter of the visualizations was up to the individual. I chose to explore a dataset that included all base statistics for every Pokemon, as it gave me a wide range of data to analyze and draw conclusions between.
