For MSU's data science capstone, the class is broken into groups and assigned a community sponsor whom they must collaborate with in order to create a minimally viable product. The goal of this capstone project is to give students technical experience in their field. My group was assigned to create a prototype of a website that utilized web-scraping and API technology in order to pull the personal/affiliate information on locally appointed public officials in the Detroit area. The purpose of this prototype is to provide initial research to the Documenters organization, which trains citizens to sit in on public meetings and take notes, with the goal to encourage transparency and accessibility in local politics. A website such as the one my group created would possibly be used as an aid during training and before meetings so that a note-taker might have a better understanding of the individuals speaking at these meetings. Linked below is a copy of the final report and presentation, as well as the website itself!
